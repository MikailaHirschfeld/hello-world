# hello-world
This is a short description 

Ah..hello there!

I trust you are a friend of freedom? My name is Mikaila, but Mika is shorter and more unique, so it makes a good varName. Either is good, but don't overwork yourself. I enjoy reading fantasy, talking about everything from guattari's rhizomes to my own histones, and writing code so I don't have to do the same boring tasks over and o. I love and hate math, I love it because it's fun, hate it cause I make stupid mistakes and my forehead is turning a disturbing shade of violet. What's your favorite movie? Book? TV show? Idol? Family member? Language? OS? I am definitely not collecting responses to be automatically stored in my people folder for later. Do not worry mortal. If you happen to be Taliesin Jaffe and reading this, I am currently looking for a patron.
